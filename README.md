# Statistical Rethinking (2nd) Python Examples

This repo contains Python examples of Statistical Rethinking (the 2nd edition) based on the existing examples from https://github.com/fehiepsi/rethinking-numpyro in Jupyter notebooks. I want to clarity that my notebooks will be almost identical copies of the notebooks in fehiepsi's repo. I may add some added material to the notebooks such as
- Text summaries from the book to understand the examples better
- Additional figures that would help me better understand the examples in the book
- Minor style changes 

I created this repo to study examples of the book and learn how to use [numpyro](https://num.pyro.ai/).
